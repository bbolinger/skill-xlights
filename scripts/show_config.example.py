"""The show's layout, as the generator sees it. Copy to show_config.py and fill in for your show
(`./run layout_report.py --draft-config > show_config.py` writes a starting point).

This example is the lol2026 show the skill was built on. Names must match xlights_rgbeffects.xml exactly.
The comments matter as much as the names: write down what each prop physically IS, because good sequencing
treats a tree-trunk wrap differently from a free-standing matrix wall.
